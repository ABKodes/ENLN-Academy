          As a nutritionist and public health instructor, my passion is guiding
          individuals toward informed and sustainable well-being. With a
          background in nutrition science and relevant certifications, I blend
          evidence-based practices with interactive methods in my instruction.
          In personalized consultations, I create tailored meal plans and
          conduct assessments, while my role as a public health worker involves
          contributing to community initiatives and health advocacy. Committed
          to staying current, I strive to inspire a holistic approach to health,
          emphasizing the deep connection between nutrition, lifestyle, and
          overall well-being. Whether in the classroom or consultations, I aim
          to foster a culture of health and contribute to individual and
          community growth.
